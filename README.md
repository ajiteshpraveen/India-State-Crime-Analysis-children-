# India-State-Crime-Analysis-children-
The data is present in csv format . Java is used to read and analyse data . Complete linkage hierarchical clustering is done and dendogram is created using  RStudio.
It gives a comparison of the states of India on the crimes commited on children by Male and Female and thus the data can be used to compare the safety of each state.
No external liberaries are used for the implementation and the functions are custom built according the data set used.
Changing a max of 5 lines will enable the source code to run for any kind of Data set.
Just a note : Clustering technique uses only the numerical values.( So be careful with what data and format you are using )
The source code is pretty self explanatory
